### Hi there 👋 
#### I'm Metiu19

- 🇮🇹 Italian electronics and robotics student
- 💻 I'm probably programming right now (Mainly for games and sometimes for small projects)
- 🎮 Games servers admin (The list is too long, just ask me if I know it)
- 🔤 I make **A LOT** of spelling errors because I have dyslexia, so if you spot any of them just let me know!
- 📥 You can reach me on Discord `metiu19`

Most of my public repos are beginner stuff and small projects, eventually I'll make real projects!
